                            Emilio Ross Binuya, Joshua Allen Custodio, Doniel Ray Medrano, and Ayeisha Breanna Alemania are all Grade 9 
                            Scholars of section Pinatubo in PSHS-CLC. This quartet is something unusual, I must say. All four of us were 
                            never grouped together for an assessment before. All of us have one thing in common: we’re all fifteen years 
                            old, which contributes to how we relate to each other. We’re also cat lovers, except for Joshua who prefers 
                            dogs. Most importantly, <span id="luvpisay">we L0v3 Pe3S1igh</span>!

                            Ross particularly enjoys watching movies and reading light novels of the genres and themes sci-fi, school, 
                            romantic comedy, magic, fantasy, and thriller. He, as mentioned above, is a cat person. However, he discovered 
                            this fact only during quarantine. He particularly dislikes messy workplaces, warm drinking water, and people 
                            who do not appreciate the hardwork authors, animators, and illustrators put into their animes, mangas, and light 
                            novels. His favorite cartoon growing up is Adventure Time.

                            Joshua likes the color white, dogs, and Adventure Time. He dislikes whenever his time is wasted for no reason. 
                            As of now, he performs his school tasks during his free time.

                            Don enjoys the color blue and Tom and Jerry. He enjoys his freetime playing Perfect World and Mobile Legends. 
                            He also enjoys watching anime; his favorites are Wonder Egg, Priority, and Saekano.

                            Ai likes to make binder covers in their freetime. They do this to save up money for their other 
                            (expensive... help) hobby which is photocard collecting. She enjoys the color red and she adores her 
                            pusang-kalye Persian crossbreed kitten Tsukki. She dislikes the sound of chalk grinding on the board, 
                            unkept workplaces, and beating around the bush.
